# REALM OF TRAINING - Game Design Document

**Last Updated:** 2025-11-27 (Sparring with the Trainers)
**Update Frequency:** Every ~50k tokens or when significant changes occur

## 🎮 THE GAME VISION

**This is an RPG Idler game about training an AI hero.**

Your hero **DIO** (a Qwen3-0.6B model) battles through quests (training data), learning skills (SY, BIN), and growing stronger. You watch from the **Tavern** as DIO fights, levels up, and becomes a champion.

### The Experience

```
1. Open the Tavern (http://localhost:8888)
2. See DIO - your hero - with stats, level, XP
3. Watch battles (training runs) in real-time
4. Track quest completion and skill progression
5. Manage the Vault (checkpoints, models)
6. Everything feels like playing a game
```

### Core Game Loop

```
DROP QUEST → DIO BATTLES → GAIN XP → LEVEL UP → UNLOCK SKILLS → REPEAT
   (inbox)      (training)    (steps)   (1000 steps)  (curriculum)
```

### Key URLs

| Location | URL | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| **Tavern** | http://localhost:8888 | Main game UI - DIO, battles, stats |
| **Quests** | http://localhost:8888/quests | Quest board - manage training queue |
| **Oracle** | http://localhost:8888/oracle | Talk to DIO - chat with any checkpoint |
| **Vault** | http://localhost:8888/vault | Browse checkpoints, zones, assets |
| **Settings** | http://localhost:8888/settings | Config, VRAM calc, scheduler |
| **Scheduler** | http://localhost:8888/scheduler | Curriculum scheduling |
| Guild Hall | http://localhost:8888/guild | Skill progression dashboard |
| VaultKeeper API | http://localhost:8767/api/stats | Asset & Ledger API |

### Start Playing

```bash
# Start everything (The Weaver manages all services)
./scripts/start_all.sh

# Or manually check/start services
python3 weaver/weaver.py --status   # Check tapestry
python3 weaver/weaver.py            # Check and mend broken threads
python3 weaver/weaver.py --daemon   # Run continuously

# Stop everything
./scripts/stop_all.sh
```

## 🦸 THE HERO: DIO

**DIO** is your AI hero - a Qwen3-0.6B model learning to reason.

| Stat | Meaning | Source |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Level** | Training progress | Steps / 1000 |
| **XP** | Experience points | Total training steps |
| **ATK** | Damage dealt | 1 / Loss (lower loss = higher ATK) |
| **DEF** | Defense | 1 / Validation loss |
| **ACC** | Accuracy | Curriculum eval accuracy |
| **Gold** | Currency | Completed quests × 100 |

### Skills

| Skill | Icon | Description | Levels | API Port |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **SY** | 🧩 | Syllacrostic word puzzles (signal degradation) | L1-50 | 8080 |
| **BIN** | 🔢 | Binary arithmetic with circled notation | L1-30 | 8090 |

Skills are defined in `configs/skills/*.yaml` - YAML is the single source of truth.

### Progression

- Every **1000 steps** = Level up
- **80% accuracy** over 3 evals = Skill level up
- Complete quests = Earn gold
- Lower loss = Higher damage

## 🎯 GAME ROADMAP (What's Missing)

The Tavern displays data. To feel like a **complete game**, we need:

### Phase 1: Actions from the Game
- [ ] **Start Quest** - Drop files in inbox from the UI
- [ ] **Pause/Resume Battle** - Control training from Tavern
- [ ] **Promote Champion** - Deploy best checkpoint from UI
- [x] **View Quest Board** - See pending quests, priorities ✅ `/quests`

### Phase 2: More Game Feel
- [ ] **Notifications** - "Quest complete!", "Level up!", "New champion!"
- [ ] **Sound Effects** - Battle sounds, level up chimes (optional)
- [ ] **Animations** - Damage numbers, XP floating up
- [ ] **Achievement System** - Milestones tracked

### Phase 3: Graphics
- [ ] **Hero Portrait** - Replace ASCII with actual image
- [ ] **Skill Icons** - Visual icons for SY, BIN
- [ ] **Battle Animations** - Visual feedback during training

### Phase 4: Full Control
- [x] **Armory Screen** - Edit config.json from UI ✅ `/settings` + VRAM calc
- [ ] **Vault Browser** - Browse/delete/export checkpoints
- [x] **Guild Management** - Adjust curriculum, skill priorities ✅ `/settings` scheduler

## 📦 RECENT UPDATES

**CRITICAL BUG FIX: Packing + Masking (2025-11-27)**
- ❌ **Bug**: Model outputting garbage like "You are happy. You enjoy helping others."
- ❌ **Cause**: Packing combines multiple examples, but collator only masked FIRST instruction
- ❌ **Result**: Model trained on ALL subsequent instructions, system prompts, user messages
- ✅ **Fix**: `custom_collator.py` now finds ALL `<|im_start|>assistant` → `<|im_end|>` segments
- ✅ **Validation**: New `masking_validators.py` with 5 validators to prevent recurrence:
  1. `MaskingRatioValidator` - Ensures 30-85% masked
  2. `ResponseTemplateCountValidator` - Verifies template count matches regions
  3. `TrainedTokenContentValidator` - Checks for instruction markers in trained tokens
  4. `PackedSequenceValidator` - Validates mask/train alternation pattern
  5. `LabelDistributionValidator` - Detects anomalous label patterns
- ✅ **Integration**: `train.py` now runs full validation suite before training
- ✅ **Fail-safe**: Training aborts if masking < 25%

**Sparring with the Trainers + Task Master (2025-11-27)**
- ✅ **Self-correction system** - DIO spars with skill trainers, learns from mistakes
- ✅ **3 training examples per wrong answer**:
  1. Identify incorrect: "Is this correct?" → "It is incorrect."
  2. Correct it: "Find the correct solution." → [golden answer]
  3. Confirm correct: [fresh problem] "Is this correct?" → "It is correct."
- ✅ **Always HIGH priority** - Sparring data is checkpoint-specific, becomes stale!
- ✅ **Task Master** (`guild/task_master.py`) - GPU-aware task scheduler
- ✅ **Task Registry** (`guild/task_registry.py`) - 11 registered tasks
- ✅ **Monitors both GPUs** - Runs tasks when utilization <40%
- ✅ **Usage**:
  - `python3 guild/task_master.py --status` - Show GPU + task status
  - `python3 guild/task_master.py --once` - Check and run one task
  - `python3 guild/task_master.py --daemon` - Run continuously

**Curriculum Fix (2025-11-27)**
- ✅ **Fixed level mismatch** - `current_level` now correctly means "mastered level"
- ✅ **Reset to 0** - Both skills reset to mastered=0, training on level 1
- ✅ **Progress bar verified** - API returns correct `batch_total_steps`

**The Weaver - Daemon Orchestrator (2025-11-27)**
- ✅ **One daemon to rule them all** - The Weaver watches all threads
- ✅ **Auto-restart** - Dead daemons automatically restarted
- ✅ **Data flow** - Generates training data when queue runs low
- ✅ **Threads monitored**: Training Daemon, Tavern, VaultKeeper, Data Flow
- ✅ **Simple startup** - `./scripts/start_all.sh` starts The Weaver
- ✅ **Status check** - `python3 weaver/weaver.py --status`

**Oracle Strict Version Checking (2025-11-27)**
- ✅ **No fallback** - Chat fails clearly if requested step not loaded
- ✅ **Accurate status** - Uses `/models/info` (actual pool) not stale `/health`
- ✅ **Step required** - Chat API requires explicit step parameter
- ✅ **Version verification** - Response includes server-confirmed `model` and `model_path`
- ✅ **Multi-model display** - Status shows ALL loaded models, not just "active"

**Tavern UI Expansion (2025-11-27 Late)**
- ✅ **Quests Page** (`/quests`) - Full quest board with queue management
  - View queued/processing/completed/failed quests
  - Change priority, delete, retry failed quests
  - Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- ✅ **VRAM Calculator** (`/settings`) - Estimate GPU memory usage
  - Based on batch size, max length, precision, gradient checkpointing
  - GPU presets (RTX 4090/3090/4080/4070)
  - Visual breakdown: model weights, optimizer, gradients, activations
- ✅ **Scheduler in Settings** (`/settings`) - Full curriculum scheduler integration
  - Quick presets (8 options)
  - Strategy selection (equal, focus, weighted, catch-up)
  - Per-skill enable/disable, priority, weight
  - Next decision preview

**Checkpoint Ledger & Distributed Architecture (2025-11-27)**
- ✅ **Checkpoint Ledger** (`core/checkpoint_ledger.py`) - Single source of truth for checkpoint stats
- ✅ **Canonical Naming** - Checkpoints named `checkpoint-{step}-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMM}`
- ✅ **Sidecar Files** - Each checkpoint has `.ledger.json` with stats at save time
- ✅ **Host Registry** (`core/hosts.py`) - Service discovery for distributed operation
- ✅ **Branch Officers** (`vault/branch_officer.py`) - Zone daemons for 3090/NAS
- ✅ **Zone Federation** (`vault/zones.py`) - Transfer assets between zones
- ✅ **Oracle Page** (`/oracle`) - "Talk to DIO" - chat with any checkpoint
- ✅ **Ledger API** on VaultKeeper - `/api/ledger/*` endpoints
- ✅ **Training API** on VaultKeeper - `/api/training/*` endpoints
- ✅ **Save frequency** - Now every 10k steps (was saving every file)

## 📋 COMMUNICATION STYLE

**Default mode: Factual technical documentation**

- State facts about system behavior, configuration, and current state
- Do not include recommendations, suggestions, or opinions unless explicitly asked
- Do not add phrases like "I recommend", "you should", "it's best to", "consider"
- Present options without bias when multiple approaches exist
- Omit evaluative language ("excellent", "better", "perfect", "brilliant")
- When asked "how does X work", describe the mechanism without suggesting changes
- When asked "what are the options", list them without ranking

**Example:**
- ❌ "I recommend using batch_size=30 because it's more efficient"
- ✅ "batch_size=30 uses ~21GB VRAM. batch_size=16 uses ~14GB VRAM"

**Only add recommendations when:**
- Explicitly asked ("what should I do?", "which is better?")
- Critical safety issue (data loss, system damage)
- User makes factual error that needs correction

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES

### Documentation Policies

1. **7 Canonical Docs** - Only write to these 7 files:
   - `README.md` - System overview
   - `QUICKSTART.md` - Getting started guide
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` - How the system works
   - `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Common problems and solutions
   - `REMOTE_INFERENCE.md` - **⭐ Remote RTX 3090 inference server (primary reference)**
   - `DEVELOPMENT.md` - Working on the codebase
   - `CHANGELOG.md` - Track changes

2. **CLAUDE.md Updates** - Update this file every ~50k tokens or when significant changes occur

3. **No Other Docs** - Do NOT create any other .md files without explicit user permission

4. **Remote Inference Focus** - See `REMOTE_INFERENCE.md` for all inference/generation tasks. This training machine does NOT run inference.

### Safety Policies

1. **NEVER delete `models/current_model/` without explicit user permission**
2. **ALWAYS create backup before risky operations**
3. **NEVER modify `config.json` critical parameters without user approval:**
   - `max_length`
   - `model_name`
   - `base_model`
4. **ASK FIRST** before making system-wide changes

## 🏰 RPG ARCHITECTURE

**NEW (2025-11-26)** - Full RPG-themed wrapper modules

The training system now has RPG-themed wrappers providing intuitive naming:

```
REALM (realm.py) - Unified entry point
├── guild/          # Skills, quests, progression, dispatch
├── arena/          # Training execution (battles)
├── watchtower/     # Monitoring and observation
├── vault/          # Storage and versioning
├── sentinels/      # System protection
├── armory/         # Equipment/profiles
├── scrolls/        # Utility scripts
└── tavern/         # Game UI (hero view, battle status) - port 8888
```

**Quick Start:**
```python
from realm import Realm
r = Realm()

# Check training status
vision = r.watchtower.pool.gaze()
print(f"Battle: {vision.battle_state}")

# Check system health
patrol = r.sentinels.inspector.full_patrol()
print(f"Healthy: {patrol.is_all_clear}")

# Register storage
from vault import StorageRegistry, StrongholdType
registry = StorageRegistry(base_dir)
registry.register_stronghold(
    name="synology_main",
    stronghold_type=StrongholdType.NAS,
    host="192.168.x.x"
)
```

**RPG → Technical Mapping:**
| RPG Term | Technical Equivalent |
|----------|---------------------|
| Quest | Training data file |
| Battle | Training run |
| Damage | Loss (lower = better) |
| Champion | Best checkpoint |
| Oracle | Inference server |
| Stronghold | Storage location |
| Scroll | Utility script |
| VaultKeeper | Asset registry (knows what's where) |
| Tavern | Game UI (where adventurers gather) |

---

## 🗃️ VAULTKEEPER - ASK VAULT FIRST

**NEW (2025-11-26)** - Central asset registry across all devices

The VaultKeeper tracks where every asset (checkpoint, model, data, config) lives across all strongholds. Before loading anything, ask the VaultKeeper first.

### The Pattern: Ask Vault First

```python
from vault import ask_vault_first

# OLD WAY (hardcoded path):
model_path = "/path/to/training/models/checkpoint-175000"

# NEW WAY (ask vault first):
model_path = ask_vault_first(
    "checkpoint_175000",
    fallback="/path/to/training/models/checkpoint-175000"
)

# The keeper will:
# 1. Look up the asset in its catalog
# 2. Find the best available location (local > NAS > remote)
# 3. Fetch it locally if needed
# 4. Return the local path
```

### Quick Start

```python
from vault import VaultKeeper, VaultDiscovery

# Initialize keeper
keeper = VaultKeeper()

# Scan and register all local assets (run once)
discovery = VaultDiscovery()
discovery.scan_all()

# Now locate any asset
result = keeper.locate("checkpoint_175000")
print(f"Found at: {result.best_location.path}")

# Fetch from best source (may be NAS or 3090)
result = keeper.fetch("checkpoint_175000", "/tmp/local_copy")
```

### API Server (for 3090 and other devices)

```bash
# Start VaultKeeper server on 4090
nohup python3 vault/server.py --port 8767 > logs/vault_keeper.log 2>&1 &

# Query from 3090
curl http://192.168.x.x:8767/api/locate/checkpoint_175000
curl http://192.168.x.x:8767/api/stats
curl http://192.168.x.x:8767/api/checkpoints
```

### Client Library (for remote devices)

```python
from vault.client import VaultKeeperClient

# On 3090, connect to 4090's VaultKeeper
client = VaultKeeperClient("192.168.x.x:8767")

# Find checkpoint
result = client.locate("checkpoint_175000")
if result.found:
    print(f"Found at: {result.best_location.path}")

# Ensure local (fetch if needed)
local_path = client.ensure_local("checkpoint_175000")
```

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|

## 📖 CHECKPOINT LEDGER - STATS AT SAVE TIME

**NEW (2025-11-27)** - Single source of truth for checkpoint metadata

The Checkpoint Ledger records exact stats when each checkpoint is saved. Every checkpoint has:
- **Canonical name**: `checkpoint-{step}-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMM}`
- **Stats at save time**: loss, val_loss, learning_rate, epoch
- **Training context**: skill_name, skill_level, training_file
- **Sidecar file**: `.ledger.json` inside each checkpoint directory

### Usage

```python
from core.checkpoint_ledger import get_ledger, record_checkpoint

# Get the ledger
ledger = get_ledger()

# Query checkpoints
latest = ledger.get_latest()
best = ledger.get_best(metric="train_loss")
all_records = ledger.list_all(limit=20)

# Get specific checkpoint
record = ledger.get(190000)
print(f"Loss: {record.train_loss}")
print(f"Canonical: {record.canonical_name}")  # checkpoint-190000-20251127-1430

# Parse any checkpoint name
from core.checkpoint_ledger import extract_step
step = extract_step("checkpoint-190000-20251127-1430")  # 190000
```

### Canonical Name Format

```
checkpoint-190000-20251127-1430
         │        │        └── Time (HHMM)
         │        └── Date (YYYYMMDD)
         └── Step number
```

### API Endpoints (on VaultKeeper :8767)

```bash
# List all checkpoints with stats
curl http://localhost:8767/api/ledger

# Get specific checkpoint
curl http://localhost:8767/api/ledger/190000

# Get best by metric
curl http://localhost:8767/api/ledger/best?metric=train_loss
```

### Key Files

```
core/checkpoint_ledger.py  # Ledger system
status/checkpoint_ledger.json  # Central index
current_model/checkpoint-*/.ledger.json  # Sidecar files
```

### RemoteLedgerClient (for remote hosts)

When running on a remote host (3090, NAS), use `RemoteLedgerClient` to query the ledger API:

```python
from core.checkpoint_ledger import RemoteLedgerClient, get_ledger_client

# Option 1: Auto-detect (local vs remote)
ledger = get_ledger_client()  # Uses local ledger on 4090, remote API elsewhere

# Option 2: Explicit remote client
client = RemoteLedgerClient("http://192.168.x.x:8767/api/ledger")

# Same interface as local ledger
latest = client.get_latest()
best = client.get_best(metric="train_loss")
all_records = client.list_all(limit=20)
record = client.get(190000)

# Check if API is reachable
if client.is_available():
    print("Ledger API online")
```

---

## 🌐 HOST REGISTRY - SERVICE DISCOVERY

**NEW (2025-11-27)** - Location-independent service access

The Host Registry defines where all services run. Components query it instead of hardcoding IPs.

**Components using Host Registry:**
- **Tavern** (`tavern/server.py`) - For Oracle/inference hosts
- **RemoteLedgerClient** (`core/checkpoint_ledger.py`) - For ledger API URL
- **Zone Federation** (`vault/zones.py`) - For zone endpoints

### Usage

```python
from core.hosts import get_service_url, get_host, is_trainer_local

# Get service URL
ledger_url = get_service_url("ledger")  # http://192.168.x.x:8767/api/ledger
inference_url = get_service_url("inference")  # http://192.168.x.x:8765

# Check if we're on the trainer
if is_trainer_local():
    ledger = get_ledger()  # Local file access
else:
    # Use remote API
    pass

# Get host config
host = get_host("3090")
print(host.name)  # "Inference Server"
print(host.models_dir)  # /path/to/models
```

### Configuration (`config/hosts.json`)

```json
{
  "hosts": {
    "4090": {
      "name": "Training Server",
      "host": "192.168.x.x",
      "role": "trainer",

## 🔮 ORACLE - TALK TO DIO

**UPDATED (2025-11-27)** - Strict version checking, no fallbacks

The Oracle lets you chat with any checkpoint loaded on the inference server.

### Access

Visit: **http://localhost:8888/oracle**

### Features

1. **View Loaded Models** - See ALL models currently in the inference pool
2. **Select Checkpoint** - Pick from ledger OR from loaded models
3. **Strict Chat** - Step parameter REQUIRED, no fallback to wrong model
4. **Version Verification** - Response confirms which model was actually used

### Strict Version Checking

The Oracle enforces strict version verification:
- **Step required** - Chat requests MUST specify which step to use
- **No fallback** - If requested step not loaded, fails with 404 (not silent wrong model)
- **Server verification** - Response includes `model` and `model_path` confirming what ran
- **Accurate status** - Uses `/models/info` (actual loaded models) not stale `/health`

### API

```bash
# Get oracle status (shows ALL loaded models)
curl http://localhost:8888/oracle/status
# Returns: {"hosts": {"3090": {"loaded_models": [...], "model_count": 3}}}

# Load checkpoint on host
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/oracle/load \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"step": 181865, "host": "3090"}'

# Chat (step REQUIRED)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/oracle/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello DIO!", "host": "3090", "step": 181865}'
# Returns: {"success": true, "model": "checkpoint-181865", "model_path": "..."}

# Chat with base model (step 0)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/oracle/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hello!", "host": "3090", "step": 0}'

# Request unloaded step (fails clearly)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/oracle/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Hi", "host": "3090", "step": 148000}'
# Returns: {"success": false, "error": "Step 148000 not loaded. Available: [...]"}
```

## ⚔️ SPARRING WITH THE TRAINERS

**NEW (2025-11-27)** - Learn from combat mistakes

When DIO spars with skill trainers, every wrong answer generates 3 training examples:

| # | Type | Prompt | Golden Answer |
|---|------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Identify Wrong | `[problem + wrong answer] Is this correct?` | `It is incorrect.` |
| 2 | Correct It | `[problem + wrong answer] This is incorrect. Find the correct solution.` | `[golden answer]` |
| 3 | Confirm Right | `[fresh problem + golden] Is this correct?` | `It is correct.` |

### Usage

```bash
# Run sparring session (100 problems)
python3 guild/sparring.py --skill binary --count 100

# Specific checkpoint
python3 guild/sparring.py --skill binary --checkpoint checkpoint-180000

# Validate sparring files
python3 guild/sparring_validator.py --check-all
```

### Task Registry

Tasks available for future Task Master scheduling:

```bash
# List all tasks
python3 guild/task_registry.py list

# Show tasks ready to run on 3090
python3 guild/task_registry.py available --gpu 3090

# Run a task manually
python3 guild/task_registry.py run --task sparring_binary
```

### Key Points

- **Always HIGH priority queue** - Sparring data is checkpoint-specific, becomes stale when model advances
- **Requires 3090** - Uses inference API for testing
- **Auto-queued** - Results go directly to `queue/high/`
- **Status**: `status/sparring.json`

### Files

```
guild/
├── sparring.py           # Main sparring system
├── sparring_validator.py # Dedicated validator

## 🤖 TASK MASTER - GPU-AWARE SCHEDULER

**NEW (2025-11-27)** - Runs tasks when GPU resources are available

The Task Master monitors GPU utilization on both 4090 and 3090, running tasks opportunistically when resources are idle (<40% utilization).

### Usage

```bash
# Check status
python3 guild/task_master.py --status

# Run one task (if GPU idle)
python3 guild/task_master.py --once

# Run as daemon (continuous)
python3 guild/task_master.py --daemon --interval 60

# Force run specific task
python3 guild/task_master.py --run sparring_binary
```

### Registered Tasks (by priority)

| Pri | Task | GPU | Description |
|-----|------|-----|-------------|
| **10** | `process_eval_queue` | 3090 | Process pending evals (from checkpoint saves) |
| 9 | `sparring_binary` | 3090 | Sparring session (100 problems) |
| 9 | `sparring_sy` | 3090 | SYLLO sparring (disabled) |
| 8 | `sparring_binary_large` | 3090 | Extended sparring (500 problems) |
| 6 | `generate_binary` | none | Generate training data |
| 4 | `health_check` | none | System health check |
| 4 | `validate_queue` | none | Validate queue files |
| 3 | `checkpoint_cleanup` | none | Clean old checkpoints |
| 3 | `vault_scan` | none | Scan VaultKeeper assets |
| 2 | `model_warmup` | 3090 | Warm up inference model |
| 2 | `lineage_report` | none | Data lineage report |

**Note**: Evals are ONLY run once per checkpoint. The `process_eval_queue` task checks for pending evals (queued when checkpoints are saved) and processes them. It does NOT re-run evals.

### Task Registry CLI

```bash
# List all tasks
python3 guild/task_registry.py list

# Show available tasks for GPU
python3 guild/task_registry.py available --gpu 3090

# Check task status/cooldowns
python3 guild/task_registry.py status
```

### Status Files

- `status/task_master.json` - Current GPU status, last task run
- `status/task_state.json` - Task execution history, cooldowns

## 🏰 ZONE FEDERATION - BRANCH OFFICERS

**NEW (2025-11-27)** - Distributed asset management

Each zone (4090, 3090, NAS) can run a Branch Officer daemon that tracks local assets.

### Start Branch Officer

```bash
# On 3090
python3 vault/branch_officer.py --zone 3090 --port 8768 --base-dir /path/to/models

# On NAS
python3 vault/branch_officer.py --zone nas --port 8768 --base-dir /volume1/data/llm_training
```

### Branch Officer API (port 8768)

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/status` | GET | Zone health and stats |
| `/assets` | GET | List local assets |
| `/assets/{id}` | GET | Get asset details |
| `/fetch/{id}` | GET | Get transfer info |
| `/scan` | POST | Scan for new assets |
| `/receive` | POST | Prepare to receive asset |

### Transfer Between Zones

```python
from vault import push_to_zone, pull_from_zone

# Push checkpoint to 3090
result = push_to_zone(
    "/path/to/training/current_model/checkpoint-190000-20251127-1430",
    "3090"
)

# Pull from 3090
result = pull_from_zone(
    "/path/to/models/checkpoint-190000-20251127-1430",
    "3090"
)
```

## 🎯 SKILL SYSTEM (Updated 2025-11-27)

**YAML configs are the single source of truth for skills.**

### Skill Configs

Location: `configs/skills/*.yaml`

| File | Skill | Icon | Levels | API |
|------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| `sy.yaml` | Word Weaving | 🧩 | 50 | localhost:8080 |
| `bin.yaml` | Binary Alchemy | 🔢 | 30 | localhost:8090 |
| `_template.yaml` | Template for new skills | - | - | - |

### Usage

```python
from guild.skills import get_skill, get_trainer, list_skills

# List available skills
skills = list_skills()  # ['bin', 'sy']

# Load skill config (all metadata from YAML)
skill = get_skill('sy')
print(skill.icon)       # 🧩
print(skill.color)      # #8B5CF6
print(skill.max_level)  # 50
print(skill.api_url)    # http://localhost:8080

# Get trainer (API client) for generating samples
trainer = get_trainer('sy')
batch = trainer.sample(level=5, count=100)
```

### Adding a New Skill

1. Copy `configs/skills/_template.yaml` to `configs/skills/{id}.yaml`
2. Fill in all required fields (see template for structure)
3. Implement the API server in singleSKILL
4. That's it - no code changes needed in TRAINING

### Key Design Principles

- **Combinatorially Infinite**: Every skill MUST have infinite problem space
- **Static Eval Sets**: 5 samples per level, seeded for reproducibility
- **Signal Degradation**: Higher levels = weaker hints (for SY) or harder params (for BIN)

### Files

```
configs/skills/
├── _template.yaml   # Template with all required fields
├── sy.yaml          # SY - Syllacrostic puzzles (50 levels)
└── bin.yaml         # BIN - Binary arithmetic (30 levels)

## 📝 NOTES FOR CLAUDE

1. Run health check: `python3 safety/comprehensive_health_check.py`
2. **ASK USER** before making changes
3. **ASK USER** before creating new documentation
4. Trust code as ground truth, not old docs
