## 💰 Pack Pricing Psychology

### The Decoy Effect

**Setup:**
```
COMPARE:

□ Pay-As-You-Go
  $0.01/example
  100k examples = $1,000

□ Discovery Pack (DECOY)
  $99 for 10k examples
  ($0.0099/example)
  Saves: $1

☑ Acceleration Pack (TARGET)
  $499 for 100k examples
  ($0.00499/example)
  Saves: $501 (50%!)
```

**Why it works:**
- Discovery Pack makes Acceleration look amazing
- 50% off sounds incredible vs 1% off
- Middle option pushed by poor middle choice

### The Anchoring Effect

**Always show:**
1. Regular pay-as-you-go price (anchor)
2. Savings vs this price (looks huge)
3. Effective rate per example (seems cheap)

**Example:**
```
100,000 examples

Pay-as-you-go: $1,000
Acceleration Pack: $499

YOU SAVE: $501 (50%)
Effective rate: $0.00499 per example
```

### The "Too Good to Pass Up" Effect

**Frame it as:**
- Limited time (urgency)
- Limited quantity (scarcity)
- Never available again (FOMO)
- Exclusive access (status)
