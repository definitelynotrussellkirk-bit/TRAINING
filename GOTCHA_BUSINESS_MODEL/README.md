# GOTCHA - AI Training Data as a Service

**Tagline:** "Find the limit of what's possible."

## 🎯 Core Concept

Not a subscription. Not a commitment. Just **pay-as-you-go with automatic volume discounts** that reward customers for discovering how good their models can be.

## 🔥 The Hook

1. **Try it cheap/free** → See immediate model improvement
2. **Buy more** → Get better rates + better model
3. **Scale up** → Unlock new discount tiers
4. **Get addicted** → Can't stop now, model keeps improving!
5. **Lock-in** → Why pay more elsewhere? You're at 75% discount here!

## 💰 Why It Works

**Traditional SaaS:** Pay $X/month, get Y value (static)
**GOTCHA Model:** Pay more → Get better rates + better model (compounding)

**Result:** Each customer becomes MORE valuable over time (negative churn!)

## 🎮 The Psychology

We're leveraging:
- **Progress addiction** ("How good can I make this?")
- **Sunk cost fallacy** ("Already invested 100k examples...")
- **Discovery mentality** ("What's the limit?")
- **Gamification** (Unlock next tier!)
- **FOMO** ("Almost at the next discount!")
- **Loss aversion** ("Can't switch, I'll lose my discount status!")

## 🏢 Target: Companies, Not People

**Why it's ethical:**
- Companies SHOULD want better models
- Our data actually works (not snake oil)
- Volume discounts are standard practice
- Natural discovery process (they control spend)
- Clear value proposition (see metrics)
- No tricks, just good products getting used more

**The "Gotcha":**
- It's SO good they can't stop buying
- But that's because it WORKS
- Win-win: They get great models, we get revenue
