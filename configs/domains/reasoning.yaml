# DOMAIN: REASONING
# =============================================================================
#
# A Domain is a world where the Hero trains - it defines what tasks exist,
# what data is available, and how mastery is measured.
#
# Think of Domains like WoW zones or Ready Player One planets:
# - Each has its own challenges and rewards
# - Heroes can specialize in one or visit many
# - Some are prerequisites for others
#

id: reasoning
name: "Domain of Reasoning"
rpg_name: "The Logic Spire"
version: "1.0.0"

description: >
  Structured reasoning and problem-solving tasks. Heroes in this domain
  learn to manipulate symbols, follow procedures, and solve constrained
  puzzles with precise rules.
