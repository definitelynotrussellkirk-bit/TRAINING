# Hero Titles - Threshold-based labels for capability milestones
#
# Titles are evaluated in order (first match wins).
# Conditions can check:
#   - skill.<id>.level: Skill level (1-N)
#   - skill.<id>.accuracy: Rolling accuracy (0.0-1.0)
#   - skill.<id>.primitive.<name>: Primitive accuracy (0.0-1.0)
#   - total_level: Sum of all skill levels
#   - total_steps: Training steps completed
#
# Real value: Quick visual feedback on capability thresholds.
# These aren't cosmetic - they represent meaningful training milestones.
